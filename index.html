    <h1>Colin Johnson's Online Resume</h1>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>My extensive training in humanities&mdash;specifically in English literature and film studies&mdash;has prepared me for all forms of marketing and communications writing, as well as visual forms of composition and communication. 20 years working in liberal arts college admissions has honed my knowledge of all parts of the holisitic college admissions process. My homegrown interest and informal skills development in coding and web development has expanded my skillset to encompass working in the most relevant forms of communication today: web development, social media-based video, 3D modelling &amp; animation, and idle game development.</p>
